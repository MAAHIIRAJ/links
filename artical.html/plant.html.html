<p>The Rose Line, also known as the Paris Meridian or "La Méridienne de Paris," is a significant historical and geographical marker. It is an imaginary line that runs north-south through Paris, France, and was established in the 17th century as the prime meridian for France. This meridian served as a reference point for cartographers and navigators, helping to standardize mapmaking and navigation.

    The Rose Line gained international recognition as the Prime Meridian for a brief period before the Greenwich Meridian was adopted as the global standard in 1884. Nevertheless, the Rose Line retains historical and cultural significance, with the Arago medallions marking its path through Paris, including one at the Notre-Dame Cathedral.
    
    In addition to its navigational importance, the Rose Line has captured the imaginations of countless individuals due to its association with various myths, legends, and conspiracy theories, particularly popularized by Dan Brown's novel "The Da Vinci Code." While not a central aspect of global geography today, the Rose Line remains a symbol of France's historical contribution to cartography and exploration, as well as its continued allure in the realm of mystery and intrigue.</p>

<p>Mosses are small, non-vascular flowerless plants in the taxonomic division Bryophyta (/braɪˈɒfətə/,[3] /ˌbraɪ.əˈfaɪtə/) sensu stricto. Bryophyta (sensu lato, Schimp. 1879[4]) may also refer to the parent group bryophytes, which comprise liverworts, mosses, and hornworts.[5] Mosses typically form dense green clumps or mats, often in damp or shady locations. The individual plants are usually composed of simple leaves that are generally only one cell thick, attached to a stem that may be branched or unbranched and has only a limited role in conducting water and nutrients. Although some species have conducting tissues, these are generally poorly developed and structurally different from similar tissue found in vascular plants.[6] Mosses do not have seeds and after fertilisation develop sporophytes with unbranched stalks topped with single capsules containing spores. They are typically 0.2–10 cm (0.1–3.9 in) tall, though some species are much larger. Dawsonia, the tallest moss in the world, can grow to 50 cm (20 in) in height. There are approximately 12,000 species.[2]

<p>The ferns (Polypodiopsida or Polypodiophyta) are a group of vascular plants (plants with xylem and phloem) that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. They differ from mosses by being vascular, i.e., having specialized tissues that conduct water and nutrients and in having life cycles in which the branched sporophyte is the dominant phase.

    Ferns have complex leaves called megaphylls, that are more complex than the microphylls of clubmosses. Most ferns are leptosporangiate ferns. They produce coiled fiddleheads that uncoil and expand into fronds. The group includes about 10,560 known extant species. Ferns are defined here in the broad sense, being all of the Polypodiopsida, comprising both the leptosporangiate (Polypodiidae) and eusporangiate ferns, the latter group including horsetails, whisk ferns, marattioid ferns, and ophioglossoid ferns.
