<p>A seahorse (also written sea-horse and sea horse) is any of 46 species of small marine fish in the genus Hippocampus. "Hippocampus" comes from the Ancient Greek hippókampos (ἱππόκαμπος), itself from híppos (ἵππος) meaning "horse" and kámpos (κάμπος) meaning "sea monster"[4][5] or "sea animal".[6] Having a head and neck suggestive of a horse, seahorses also feature segmented bony armour, an upright posture and a curled prehensile tail.[7] Along with the pipefishes and seadragons (Phycodurus and Phyllopteryx) they form the family Syngnathidae.</p>

<p>Jellyfish and sea jellies are the common names given to the medusa-phase of certain gelatinous members of the subphylum Medusozoa, which is a major part of the phylum Cnidaria.

    Jellyfish are mainly free-swimming marine animals with umbrella-shaped bells and trailing tentacles, although a few are anchored to the seabed by stalks rather than being mobile. The bell can pulsate to provide propulsion for highly efficient locomotion. The tentacles are armed with stinging cells and may be used to capture prey and defend against predators. Jellyfish have a complex life cycle. The medusa is normally the sexual phase, which produces planula larvae; these then disperse widely and enter a sedentary polyp phase, before reaching sexual maturity.</p>

<p>Six of the seven species of sea turtles that swim the planet’s waters—leatherback, loggerhead, Kemp’s ridley, green, olive ridley, and hawksbill—are found in every ocean except the Arctic and Antarctic. The seventh, the flatback, lives only in the waters around Australia.

    The leatherback is the largest sea turtle and can weigh a whopping 2,000 pounds. It’s also the only sea turtle that doesn’t have a hard, bony shell. Its carapace is somewhat flexible and almost rubbery to the touch. The shells of other sea turtles are made of thick plates called scutes.
